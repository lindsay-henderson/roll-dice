# Roll Dice
This is a React app that simulates rolling a pair of dice.

I built this in order to practice working with props, defaultProps, state, and simple click events in React.

This application was built as part of Colt Steele's Udemy course: 'The Modern React Bootcamp'.

#### Technologies used: 
Node.js, React, and JavaScript.
